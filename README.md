# Foodies - Food Ordering Webpage

This project is a static food ordering webpage called Foodies. It is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Foodies allow users to browse a variety of dishes, select their favourites, and place orders. I want to let you know that this webpage does not have a backend structure, and the data is static.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Foodies has a simple and intuitive design, making it easy for users to navigate and explore different food options.
- **Diverse Food Menu**: The webpage offers a wide range of delectable cuisines, giving users various choices to satisfy their cravings.
- **Order Placement**: Users can add desired dishes to their cart and proceed to place orders, creating a seamless experience for the customers.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Employed for styling and layout, enhancing the visual appeal of the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented to add interactivity and dynamic features to the webpage.
